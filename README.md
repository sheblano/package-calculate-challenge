## Package Challenge
### Introduction
You want to send your friend a package with different things.
Each thing you put inside the package has such parameters as index number, weight and cost. The
package has a weight limit. Your goal is to determine which things to put into the package so that the
total weight is less than or equal to the package limit and the total cost is as large as possible.
You would prefer to send a package which weighs less in case there is more than one package with the
same price.
